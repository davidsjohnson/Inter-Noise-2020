\textbf{\centerline{ABSTRACT}\\
Compressed air is utilized in many branches of industry and one of the most expensive energy sources of industrial plants. Therefore, efficient detection of air pressure leaks goes hand in hand with cost savings and increased  operational reliability. Some procedures of leakage detection for pressure lines are based upon the analysis of sound emissions. Such solutions use  specific ultrasonic emission patterns to detect leakage; alternatively, personnel trained to hear leaks are deployed for detection. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of using airborne sound emissions in the audible hearing range for the automated detection of compressed air leakage using artificial neural networks. Therefore, a novel dataset was created and published. It contains recordings from several microphones at different distances of adjustable leakage from a pneumatic contraption with different pressure levels. Additionally, industrial background noises were applied at different levels to simulate real-world sound environments. Using this dataset, a deep neural network was trained for leakage detection. The results show that leakage detection by means of airborne sound in the audible range using machine learning techniques is possible, and is a promising contactless and automatic detection method.}


\section{Introduction}

Compressed air is commonly used within manufacturing and other industries, and may account for up to 10\% of industrial consumption of electricity.
Compressed air systems, however, have low energy efficiency with possible energy savings from 5 to 50\%, and according to Radgen "reducing air leaks is probably the single most important energy savings measure, applicable to almost all systems" \cite{Radgen.2001}. 
Searching for leaks is often a manual process using ultrasonic hand held leak 'sniffers' \cite{Radgen.2001}, visual detection, which requires a leak spray \cite{Guenther2016:ultrasonic}, or in some cases simply using personnel trained to hear leaks.

As air, or other gas, escapes a pipeline through a leak it decompresses as it enters a lower pressure environment causing turbulence. The turbulence causes an acoustic emission allowing the leak to be detected acoustically \cite{Genuit.2010}.
For the airborne sound based detection of air, or other gas, leaks, localisation by ultrasound is a common method, whereby the detection process must take place in the immediate vicinity of the gas carrier \cite{Chen.2007}.
To avoid the distance problem of ultrasonic technologies for leak detection, this paper investigates the potential for leak detection using airborne sound in the auditory range (20 Hz - 20 kHz) combined with modern deep learning methods.

The use of audible sound in industrial settings has grown in interest in recent years for automated quality control and predictive maintenance. Using traditional audio signal processing and machine learning techniques, however, require expert based hand-crafted features for detection. The recent trend in deep learning attempts to resolve this issue with representation learning as part of the model training process \simpletodo{[REFS]}. Research in the field of industrial sound analysis (ISA) has shown the potential for the use of deep learning in industrial settings \simpletodo{[IMA REFS]}.  One of the main challenges in the application of machine learning, and especially deep learning, to an industrial task is the need for a large dataset. Oftentimes data for a specific task is expensive and time consuming to obtain.  

To our knowledge, there are no known datasets for the case of gas leak detection. Furthermore, there are no studies showing the effectiveness of  The main contributions of this work are newly published dataset for compressed air leaks to foster further research in this area, and a baseline convolution neural network (CNN) \simpletodo{[REF]} that is able to accurately detect air leaks even in noisy conditions.  To show the potential of gas leak detection using audible sound with deep learning, we perform experiments with different types of background noise and leak conditions, as well as microphones at different distances from the leak source.

% Pneumatic systems are often used in commercial vehicles and passenger transport; \simpletodo{ADD some more examples. }
% As in manufacturing, undesired gas leakage due to leaks and leaks is a frequent error pattern: Exposure of CA carriers in the area of the chassis as well as vibration make regular inspections unavoidable.  Reliable maintenance methods for gas carriers ensure safety and energy and thus cost savings \cite{Radgen.2001}. 	
% Some leakage measurement methods are based on the measurement of sound emissions.  In a given case, turbulent leakage of CA produces clear emission patterns that spread both through the air and through adjacent bodies. 
% In order to avoid the distance problem of ultrasonic technologies for leak detection, this paper investigates the possibility of airborne sound based leak detection in the auditory range (20 Hz - 20 kHz). 	
% In addition, the integration of a machine learning system into the detection process  creates new perspectives: A deep neural network (DNN) is used, the configuration of which has already proven itself in the detection of anomalies in components \cite{EstefaniaCanoJohannesNowakandSaschaGrollmisch.}. This network is trained to detect the sound signatures of CA leaks in different scenarios.


% \subsection{Gas Leaks}

% A real gas pumping system can never be absolutely tight. DIN EN 1779 lists the so-called leakage rate as a measure of the urgency of a maintenance measure. The following applies: From $q_L > >10^{-2}$ mbarL/s a leakage is classified as "turbulent" \cite{1779}. On a physical level, the pressure difference between the pipeline and the environment is so high that turbulence forms when the pipeline gas escapes. Only the occurrence of turbulence allows the leakage to be detected acoustically \cite{Genuit.2010}. The exhaust jet can be regarded as an acoustic source in the form of a quadrupole emitter \cite{Zeller.2018}, which can also be recorded well from lateral microphone positions.

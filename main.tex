\textbf{\centerline{ABSTRACT}\\
Compressed air is utilized in many branches of industry and represents one of the most expensive energy sources of industrial plants. The efficient detection of air pressure leaks goes hand-in-hand with cost savings and increased operational reliability. Some procedures of leakage detection for pressure lines are based upon the analysis of sound emissions. Such solutions use specific ultrasonic emission patterns to detect leakage; alternatively, personnel trained to hear leaks are deployed for detection. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of airborne sound analysis in the audible hearing range for the automated detection of compressed air leakage using artificial neural networks. Therefore, a novel dataset is developed and published. It contains recordings of adjustable leakage from a pneumatic contraption with different pressure levels from several microphones at different distances. Additionally, industrial background noises were applied to simulate real-world sound environments. Using this dataset, a convolutional neural network is trained for leakage detection. The results show that leakage detection by means of airborne sound in the audible range using machine learning techniques is possible and a promising contactless automated detection method.}


\section{Introduction}

Compressed air is a common source of energy in manufacturing and other industries, and may account for up to 10\% of industrial consumption of electricity.
Compressed air systems, however, have low energy efficiency with possible energy savings from 5 to 50\%, and according to Radgen  \cite{Radgen.2001} "reducing air leaks is probably the single most important energy savings measure, applicable to almost all systems". 
Searching for leaks is typically a manual process using hand held leak "sniffers" equiped with highly directional ultrasonic microphones \cite{Radgen.2001, Schenck2019:airleakslam}, or using visual detection, which requires a leak spray \cite{Guenther2016:ultrasonic}. 
To detect leaks acoustically, an operator has to walk around the entire facility pointing a listening device towards all possible leak locations in the compressed air system. Using specialized software that visualizes and auralizes the acoustic emission, the operator must then identify if a leak is present \cite{sdt:handbook}. This process requires experienced operators, is time consuming, and may require expensive shutdowns of the production facility. The effectiveness of such an approach is dependent on the expertise and the thoroughness of the sensor operator \cite{Murvay2012:survey}. 
In addition to intensive manual labor, these methods often require shutdowns of entire facilities making leak detection an expensive process \cite{Schenck2019:airleakslam}. Identifying new techniques to improve and automate this process has the potential to lead to substantial savings in industrial energy usage and costs.

As air, or other gas, escapes a pipeline through a leak it decompresses as it enters a lower pressure environment causing turbulence. The turbulence causes an acoustic emission in the audible and ultrasonic frequencies affording the use of airborne sound based methods for leak detection\cite{Genuit.2010, Eret2012:beamform}.
Typically, the detection and localization of leaks using airborne sound is performed with ultrasonic sensors, in which case the detection process must take place in the immediate vicinity of the gas carrier or use special long distance sensors \cite{Chen.2007}. Ultrasonic microphones, however, are highly susceptible to background noise due to their low energies \cite{Eret2012:beamform}.
To overcome these challenges, this paper investigates the potential for leak detection using airborne sound in the auditory range (20 Hz - 20 kHz) with modern deep learning methods. By installing microphones around the compressed air network and automatically analyzing the airborne sound with machine learning, it might be possible to monitor a large area continuously from a distance without the need to stop production processes. Faulty lines or connections could thus be identified relatively quickly and cost-effectively. 

In recent years, the use of audible sound for predictive maintenance and automated quality control in industrial settings has grown in interest. Traditional analysis methods using audio signal processing and machine learning require expert designed hand-crafted features for fault detection. Deep learning attempts to resolve this issue by making representation learning part of the model training process \cite{Lecun2015:deep}. In industrial settings, deep learning with audio has been shown to be effective for common tasks in the research field of industrial sound analysis (ISA) \cite{Grollmisch2019:isa, Grollmisch2020:pucks, Johnson2020:robust, Grollmisch2020:embeddings}. One of the main challenges in applying deep learning methods to industrial tasks is the need for a large dataset. Obtaining well-labeled data is often expensive and time consuming, causing organizations to be reluctant to integrate deep learning into their processes. To our knowledge, there are no known datasets for the case of gas and air leak detection.

To address these gaps, the contribution of this work is to present a novel dataset for compressed air leak detection together with a convolution neural network (CNN) baseline system. CNNs have been successfully applied to tasks requiring audible sound \cite{Hershey2017:audiocnn, Grollmisch2020:pucks}. Furthermore, CNNs have shown to be more robust and less prone to overfitting than traditional feed forward networks \cite{Johnson2020:robust}. To show the potential of gas leak detection using audible sound with deep learning, we perform experiments with different types of background noise and leak conditions, as well as microphones at different distances from the leak source. The benefit of such a system, is that multiple inexpensive microphones could be placed at critical locations in the compressed air network for improved automation of the leak detection process.

Section \ref{sec:rw} discusses the state-of-the-art in compressed air leak detection, and industrial sound analysis using machine learning methods. Then, the design of the experimental apparatus and data acquisition process are discussed in Sections \ref{sec:app} and \ref{sec:dataset}, followed by an explanation of the baseline classification architecture in Section \ref{sec:baseline}. Sections \ref{sec:exps} and \ref{sec:res} cover the experimental design and corresponding results. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conc} concludes the paper with a discussion of the results and directions for future work.
